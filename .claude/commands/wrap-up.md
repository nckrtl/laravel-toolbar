You are tasked with updating the CLAUDE.md and README.md files based on new information learned during this session. Your goal is to incorporate important changes and project preferences while maintaining relevance and conciseness. Follow these steps carefully:

1. Review the existing content of CLAUDE.md files throughout this project

2. Review the existing content of the README.md

3. Analyze the thing information and compacted summaries for important changes and preferences

4. Compare the session information with the existing file contents. Identify new information, changes in preferences, or important details that should be added to either CLAUDE.md files or README.md. Create new CLAUDE.md files where it makes sense. Use common sense to decide if an additional CLAUDE.md file should be created or deleted. 

5. Be brutally critical in your analysis. Only add information if it is crucial for your future self to be aware of. Consider the following:
   - Does the new information significantly change how the project should be approached?
   - Are there new preferences that contradict or update existing ones?
   - Is there any information that is no longer relevant or accurate?

6. Update the CLAUDE.md and README.md files based on your analysis:
   - Add new, relevant information
   - Modify existing content to reflect changes in preferences or approach
   - Remove outdated or irrelevant information
   - Ensure the updates maintain the overall structure and purpose of each file

7. If no updates are necessary for the .md files, explicitly state so in the respective update section.

9. After providing the updates, briefly explain your reasoning for the changes (or lack thereof) in a <justification> section.

Remember, the goal is to maintain up-to-date, relevant, and concise documentation. Only make changes that truly enhance the usefulness of these files for future reference.
